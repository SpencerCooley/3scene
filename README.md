# 3Scene.com is a place to build 3D tools for the web

Right now there is only one tool; Shader Journal. I plan to build more tools in the future. Shader Journal is a simple interface for testing glsl shaders on different geometries. This is build using Nuxt 3 so the setup is pretty easy. See below.

Look at the [Nuxt 3 documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# yarn
yarn install

# npm
npm install

# pnpm
pnpm install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on http://localhost:3000

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```

Locally preview production build:
